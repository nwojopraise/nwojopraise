                 <p><h2>  MEANING OF INVESTMENT</h2>
An investment is an asset or item acquired with the goal of generating income or appreciation. Appreciation refers to an increase in the value of an asset over time. When an individual purchases a good as an investment, the intent is not to consume the good but rather to use it in the future to create wealth. An investment always concerns the outlay of some asset today—time, money, or effort—in hopes of a greater payoff in the future than what was originally put in. For example, an investor may purchase a monetary asset now with the idea that the asset will provide income in the future or will later be sold at a higher price for a profit.<br>
         According to Economics, Investment is the value of fixed capital assets (plus stocks) produced in an economy over a period of time – investment refers to the creation of capital goods. Investment spending is an injection of capital circular flow of income. 
It could also be referred to as the amount of goods purchased or accumulated per unit time which are not consumed at the present time. <br>
                       <h2>TYPES OF INVESTMENT</h2>
Some of the important types of investment are:<br> 
1.Business fixed investment: means investment in the machines, tools and equipment that businessmen buy for use in further production of goods and services. The stock of these machines or plant equipment etc. represents fixed capital. Keynes put forward a theory of investment which states that business fixed investment is determined by expected rate of profit (which he calls marginal efficiency of capital) and rate of interest. Since rate of interest in the short run is relatively sticky, it is changes in expectations about earning profits in future that cause fluctuations in business fixed investment. <br>
 According to the neoclassical theory, business fixed investment is determined by the marginal product of capital on one hand and user’s cost of capital on the other. The user’s cost of capital merely depends on the price of capital goods, the interest rate and the depreciation rate. According to the neoclassical model, if marginal product of capital exceeds user’s cost of capital, firms will find it profitable to undertake fixed investment.<br>
    2. Residential investment: This refers to the expenditure which people make on constructing or buying new houses or dwelling apartments for the purpose of living or renting out to others. Residential investment varies from 3 per cent to 5 per cent of GDP in various countries. It depends on price of existing housing units. The higher the price of existing units, the higher will be investment in constructing and buying new housing units. The price of housing units is determined by demand for housing units which slopes downward and the supply of existing units which is a fixed quantity and its supply curve is therefore vertical straight line.
